# SATSolverProgram Using DPLL, Genetic Algorithm, and Local Search
Create a program that uses several heuristic search techniques to find possibly optimal truth assignments for variables in the given Boolean formulas.

## Overview
This program implements three heuristic search techniques to solve the Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT):
1. DPLL (Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland) Algorithm
2. Genetic Algorithm
3. Local Search (Hill Climbing)

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your machine.
2. Make sure all CNF Formula Folders are in the folder you run the program from. 
	(Should have 2, "CNF Formulas and" "HARD CNF Formulas")
3. No requirements to install, you can just run SATSolver.py
												
	Run the program using the command:
		```
	    python SATSolver.py
		```
	    or run in an IDE of your choice.
